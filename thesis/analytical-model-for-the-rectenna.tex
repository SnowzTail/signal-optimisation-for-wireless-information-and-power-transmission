A rectenna receives electromagnetic power with antenna and convert it to electric power with rectifier. Assume lossless, the equivalent circuit includes a voltage source ${v_{\text{s}}}(t)$ connected to a series antenna impedance ${Z_{{\text{ant}}}} = {R_{{\text{ant}}}} + j{X_{{\text{ant}}}}$ followed by a combined impedance of the rectifier and the matching network ${Z_{{\text{in}}}} = {R_{{\text{in}}}} + j{X_{{\text{in}}}}$, as shown in Figure {equivalent_circuit}. When perfect matched (${R_{{\text{in}}}} = {R_{{\text{ant}}}},{X_{{\text{in}}}} =  - {X_{{\text{ant}}}}$), the voltage across the rectifier equals ${v_{{\text{in}}}}(t) = {v_{\text{s}}}(t)/2 = {y_{{\text{rf}}}}(t)\sqrt {{R_{{\text{in}}}}} $ and the input power to the rectifier writes $P_{{\text{rf}}}^r = \mathbb{E}\left[ {{y_{{\text{rf}}}}{{(t)}^2}} \right] = \mathbb{E}\left[ {{v_{{\text{in}}}}{{(t)}^2}} \right]/{R_{{\text{in}}}}$.

For energy harvesting, various analytical design are available with diverse configurations (Schottky [Analytical Models][Optimum Behavior], CMOS[Co-Design][Harvesting Wireless]) and topologies (series[Conformal Hybrid][Flexible Hybrid], shunt[An Improved][Design and Experiments], number of diodes[A Low-Complexity]). In this article, we employ a simplified rectifier model proposed by [Waveform Design] that captures the fundamental diode nonlinearity in the presence of multi-carrier unmodulated (multisine) and modulated excitations. As illustrated by Figure {equivalent_circuit}, the rectifier consists of a single diode as the source of nonlinearity and a low-pass filter that stores energy. It is proved in [A Low-Complexity] that this analytical model is suitable for more complicated circuits as voltage doubler and diode bridge rectifiers.

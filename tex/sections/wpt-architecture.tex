Figure {block_diagram} [book] presents the schematic diagram of a general WPT system. The operating principle can be classified into \textit{maximum power transfer} and \textit{maximum power efficiency transfer} [A Critical]. This article is based on the efficiency criterion to reach a compromise between the harvested power and the physical limitation. As suggested in [book], the overall power transmit efficiency $e$ can be decomposed as

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:power_utilization_efficiency}
  e = \frac{{{P_{{\text{dc}},{\text{ST}}}}}}{{P_{{\text{dc}}}^t}} = \underbrace {\frac{{P_{{\text{rf}}}^t}}{{P_{{\text{dc}}}^t}}}_{{e_1}} \cdot \underbrace {\frac{{P_{{\text{rf}}}^r}}{{P_{{\text{rf}}}^t}}}_{{e_2}} \cdot \underbrace {\frac{{P_{{\text{dc}}}^r}}{{P_{{\text{rf}}}^r}}}_{{e_3}} \cdot \underbrace {\frac{{{P_{{\text{dc}},{\text{ST}}}}}}{{P_{{\text{dc}}}^r}}}_{{e_4}}
\end{equation}

where the Power Amplifier (PA) determines the DC-to-RF efficiency ${e_1}$, the channel influences the RF-to-RF efficiency ${e_2}$, the rectenna decides the RF-to-DC efficiency ${e_3}$, and the power management unit (PMU) deals with the DC-to-DC efficiency ${e_4}$. Most existing solutions assume no dependency in between and focus on maximizing each term individually then concatenate them together [see ref]. Interestingly, it has been proved by [Communications and][Waveform design][Practical nonlinear] that at least ${e_1}$, ${e_2}$ and ${e_3}$ are coupled with each other, and the problem requires a joint optimization. Indeed, ${e_1}$ is related to the Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) hence the waveform [Maximizing DC]. Similarly, ${e_2}$ is determined by the channel state and the signal characteristics as waveform, beamformer, modulation, power allocation [Fundamentals of]. Moreover, ${e_3}$ is observed as a nonlinear function of the rectifier input power ${P_{{\text{rf}}}^r}$ [Towards the][Maximum achievable][Power-optimized], which also depends on the channel state and the transmit signal [Optimum waveform][Boosting the][Fundamental of]. Therefore, the signal design has a profound impact on the overall power efficiency $e$. This article focus particularly on the optimization regarding the channel and the energy harvester to maximize ${e_2} \cdot {e_3}$. A tractable nonlinear harvester model proved beneficial to the output current [Waveform design] together with multisine power waveform that validates the model with lower input power [Communications and][Waveform design][Optimum excitation] are used in this article.

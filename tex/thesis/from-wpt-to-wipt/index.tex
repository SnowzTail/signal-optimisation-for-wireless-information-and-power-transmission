In this section, we first introduce a general WPT architecture. Next, we focus on the rectenna behavior and derive the analytical diode models for the energy harvester. We then extend the work to WIPT and explore two practical receiver structures. Finally, the signal and system model is established, and the dependency of delivered power on signal design is investigated on top of it.

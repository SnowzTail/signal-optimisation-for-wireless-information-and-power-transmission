Next, we switch to the MISO case and investigate the influence of transmit antenna (Tx) on the R-E region. The same multipath channel model is assumed in the simulation and the plots are based on the average result of 300 FF channels with $N = 4$.

Thanks to the decoupling approach, the predetermined beamforming phases ${\mathbf{\Phi }}_I^ \star ,{\mathbf{\Phi }}_P^ \star $ are optimal for MISO and the computational complexity is irrelevant to $M$. It can be observed in Figure \ref{fig:mimo} that the R-E region is convex in both cases. Although increasing $M$ essentially produces more available subbands, the impact is different from increasing $N$ and the rectifier

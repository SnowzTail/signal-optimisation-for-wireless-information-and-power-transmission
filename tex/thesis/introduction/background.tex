Energy-constrained wireless devices are conventionally powered by batteries. However, the development of large-scale networks as Internet-of-Things (IoT) is strictly restricted by its limited working time and frequent recharging or replacement. Although Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) via inductive coupling has enjoyed some success in real-world applications, it is impractical for most devices on the move since the operation range is very short. As a promising alternative, the Radio-Frequency (RF) wave is typically with lower power level (\si{\uW} to \si{W}) but larger coverage (up to hundreds of meters) \cite{Ng2019}. Interestingly, it indeed carries both information and energy simultaneously, with the potential to power billions of mobile nodes wirelessly while keeping them connected. The recent revolution in harvester model and the significant power drop of electronics bring more possibility to the research on Wireless Information and Power Transfer (WIPT) via RF signals.

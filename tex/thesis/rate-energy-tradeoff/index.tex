In this section, we first characterize the rate-energy region for the proposed system, then transform it into a general optimization problem. On top of it, we decouple the spatial and frequency design, investigate the lower bound of the superposed waveform, consider the PAPR constraint, and extend the GP method to MIMO cases.

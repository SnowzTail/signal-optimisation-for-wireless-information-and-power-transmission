In this research, we consider a dual-mode Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) wireless information and power transfer (WIPT) system with multiple Energy Harvesters (EH). To that end, we aim to design a generic transceiver architecture where a sensor node dynamically switches between single-subband and multi-subband transmissions according to the received power level. A single-tone energy level and phase modulation will be compared with a novel tone-index multisine modulation that enables information transmission with subset index. Result will be investigated for Frequency-Flat (FF) and Frequency-Selective (FS) channels. At the receiving end, a power splitter is introduced after each antenna to reallocate the received signal to different rectifiers for high energy conversion efficiency. The proposed algorithm jointly optimizes beamforming, power splitting and Mode Switching (MS) operation based on practical nonlinear EH models for single and multi-tone waveforms. Compared with the existing strategies, it is expected to produce a larger rate-energy R-E region and operating range with lower computational complexity.

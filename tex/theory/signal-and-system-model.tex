Consider a point-to-point MISO WIPT system in multipath environment. The $M$-antenna transmitter delivers information and power simultaneously to the single-antenna receiver through $N$ orthogonal subbands. It is assumed the carrier frequencies are with even spacing $\Delta f$ and equal bandwidth ${B_{\text{s}}}$ (${B_{\text{s}}} \leqslant \Delta f$). The $n$-th subband has carrier frequency ${f_n} = {f_0} + n\Delta f$ for $n = 0, \ldots ,N - 1$. To maximize the R-E tradeoff, we employ a superposed signal consists of a multi-carrier deterministic multisine waveform and a multi-carrier random modulated waveform for power and information delivery respectively. Both components are transmitted on the same frequency bands.

\section{Information Waveform}
Denote the information symbol carried by the modulated waveform on subband $n$ as ${{\tilde x}_n}$, we assume the input symbol is with the capacity-achieving i.i.d. Circular Symmetric Complex Gaussian (CSCG) distribution with zero mean and unit variance \cite{Varasteh2017a}:

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:unmodulated_symbol}
  {{\tilde x}_n} = \left| {{{\tilde x}_n}} \right|{e^{j{\phi _{\tilde x}}n}}\~\mathcal{C}\mathcal{N}(0,1)
\end{equation}

Hence, the modulated waveform on antenna $m = 1, \ldots ,M$ subband $n$ writes as

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:modulated_symbol}
  {x_{n,m}} = {w_{I,n,m}}{{\tilde x}_n}
\end{equation}

where ${w_{I,n,m}}$ is the corresponding information weight and is a constant for a certain channel state:

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:weight_information}
  {w_{I,n,m}} = \left| {{w_{I,n,m}}} \right|{e^{j{\phi _{I,n,m}}}} = {s_{I,n,m}}{e^{j{\phi _{I,n,m}}}}
\end{equation}

Note the amplitude ${s_I}$ and phase ${\phi _I}$ are separated for individual design. The modulated symbol of equation \ref{modulated_symbol} can be further expressed as:

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:modulated_symbol_further}
  {x_{n,m}} = {s_{I,n,m}}{e^{j{\phi _{I,n,m}}}} \cdot \left| {{{\tilde x}_n}} \right|{e^{j{\phi _{{{\tilde x}_n}}}}} = {{\tilde s}_{I,n,m}}{e^{j{{\tilde \phi }_{I,n,m}}}}
\end{equation}

with ${{\tilde s}_{I,n,m}} = {s_{I,n,m}}\left| {{{\tilde x}_n}} \right|$ and ${{\tilde \phi }_{I,n,m}} = {\phi _{I,n,m}} + {\phi _{{{\tilde x}_n}}}$. In this way, the impact of symbol distribution and waveform design are combined, and it can be derived that the modulated waveform also follows an i.i.d. CSCG distribution with enhanced variance ${x_{n,m}}\~\mathcal{C}\mathcal{N}\left( {0,s_{I,n,m}^2} \right)$.




























At time $t$ on antenna $m = 1, \ldots ,M$, the transmit signal ${x_m}(t)$, can be decomposed as

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:transmit_signal}

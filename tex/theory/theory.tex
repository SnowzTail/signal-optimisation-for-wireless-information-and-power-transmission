\chapter{Theory}
In long and fairly complex reports and articles, especially theoretical and experimental reports where the purpose of the document is to apply, verify, or illustrate one or more theories, include a separate section presenting relevant theoretical formulae and the techniques by which any experimental results are predicted. When introducing equations, be sure to define all symbols used in them.

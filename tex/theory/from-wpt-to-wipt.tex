\chapter{From WPT to WIPT}
In this section, we first present a general WPT architecture. Then, we focus on the rectenna behavior and derived the diode models for the energy harvester. On top of that, the dependency of delivered power on signal design is investigated

In this section, we first introduce the system model and transceiver architecture employed in the project. Then, the dependency of delivered power on the signal design is investigated with analytical harvester models. We aim to provide an overview and describe the assumptions, models.
